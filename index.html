<p>Welcome to the arena of the intelligent systems. Programmers tend to go crazy when they don't find the exact information, but no need to worry, the solution is here, Semantic Search for Questions Related to Programming...</p>

<h3>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Semantically-aware search engines have gained considerable interest in the last few years, but the actual fulfillment of the vision is still unclear. Whenever developer fires the search query about the information that they are trying to find online on the web, the search space of millions web pages being generated by the search engine. What we are trying to do is come up with one web page that satisfies most of the user search criteria, and for that, we need some sort of the intelligent system. </p>

<h3>
<a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods</h3>

<p>The proposed system accepts the user input as the search query and parses it in JAVA. Then using Natural Language Processing (NLP) we are removing the stop words and extracting keywords only which affects the query results. We are using a standard list of stopwords. Now using these extracted keywords and google ajax API, the search space of webpages is being generated. each web page is scored on the criteria of term frequency, precision, and recall. So higher the score, better the search quality. As we are trying to answer queries by beginners or early developers, we need to filter these results based on some additional parameters, like the web page having good tutorials or example with some algorithm, flowchart or basic sample code snippet will be more helpful. On the other hand, solutions provided by websites like stackoverflow.com will be less helpful because those are written by experts in very abstract manner. Additionally, these sites gave alternative solutions for the same problem. So it may be confusing for the beginners.</p>

<h3>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h3>

<p>The proposed search system is being evaluated in CS tutor lab. This is the place where students enrolled in CS-1, CS-2 and CS-3 computer science courses come to resolve the programming issues they have in their academic assignments. So when these students try to find some programming questions online, along with the existing search engines, students have been asked to use this system and then do a comparative evaluation. The students have been asked the questions like which system is better, and for what search query they are trying to search and for which course. The feedback is stored in the database via a google form.</p>

<p>As we can see in the results, the proposed system gives promising outcomes. As CS-1 is the course for beginners and they have given a good rating for the system performance. So this system can definitely be used in educational institutes, tutor labs or even for personal purposes.
As the future work, the system can be made adaptive in such a way that it will keep track of user feedback on the particular search query and its corresponding results. So whenever it came across similar search query, it can make the better decisions...</p>
