Flann\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nSemantically-aware search engines have gained considerable interest in the last few years, but the actual fulfillment of the vision is still unclear. Whenever developer fires the search query, the search space of millions web pages being generated. We observe a number of weakness in existing semantic systems, such that they do not provide a semantic document ranking model. And to come up with one web page that satisfies most of the user search criteria, we need some sort of the intelligent system. And the proposed system tries to do the same. When the user inputs the search query, it get parsed. And using Natural Language Processing (NLP) we are removing the stop words and extracting keywords only which affects the query results. Now using these keywords each web page is scored on the criteria of term frequency, precision, and recall. So higher the score, better the search quality. As we are trying to answer queries by beginners or early developers, we need to filter these results based on some additional parameters. Like the web page having good tutorials or example with some basic sample code snippet will be more helpful. On the other hand, solutions provided by websites like stackoverflow.com will be less helpful because those are written by experts in very abstract manner.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nPerformance of Search Systems\r\n![graph1](http://i.imgur.com/8WZFdmT.png)\r\nCourse Distribution of Search Results\r\n![graph2](http://i.imgur.com/wskghRS.png)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
