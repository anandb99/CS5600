Whenever developer fires the search query, the search space of millions web pages being generated. What we are trying to do is come up with one web page that satisfies most of the user search criteria, and for that, we need some sort of the intelligent system. \r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n\r\nThe proposed system accepts the user input as the search query and parses it. Then using Natural Language Processing (NLP) we are removing the stop words and extracting keywords only which affects the query results. Now using these keywords each web page is scored on the criteria of term frequency, precision, and recall. So higher the score, better the search quality. As we are trying to answer queries by beginners or early developers, we need to filter these results based on some additional parameters. Like the web page having good tutorials or example with some basic sample code snippet will be more helpful. On the other hand, solutions provided by websites like stackoverflow.com will be less helpful because those are written by experts in very abstract manner.\r\n\r\nSystem flowchart\r\n\r\n![flowchart_smallest](http://i.imgur.com/XO7gn79.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThe proposed search system is being evaluated in CS tutor lab. This is the place where students enrolled in CS-1, CS-2 and CS-3 come to resolve the programming issues they have in their academic assignments. So when these students try to find some programming questions online, along with the existing search engines, students are asked to use this system and then do a comparative evaluation. The students have been asked the questions like which system is better, and for what search query they are trying to search and for which course. The feedback is stored in the database via a google form.\r\n\r\nPerformance of Search Systems\r\n![graph1](http://i.imgur.com/8WZFdmT.png)\r\nCourse Distribution of Search Results\r\n![graph2](http://i.imgur.com/wskghRS.png)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
